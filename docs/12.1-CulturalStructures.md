# Cultural Structures


For our empirical case, we analyze textual data based on a set of
sociology abstracts (drawn from recent dissertations). We are interested
in discovering the latent topics that exist in the data, where each
topic is defined by having a distinct pattern of words associated with
it. We are also interested in seeing which abstracts get placed together
and why. In this way we are trying to uncover the underlying structure
of the field of sociology (as represented in abstracts), where certain
words and researchers are associated with a topic and certain topics are
closer to each other than others. We thus see the intuition of a network
approach played out using textual data.

    [1] "Ontogenic variables, such as the experience of the parent's abuse as a child and current_depression or substance abuse, were expected_to_have_a_greater_impact on the risk of child_abuse than microsystem and exosystem_variables such as family functioning, domestic violence, income, community safety, and social support. It was expected that social_support would have the greatest_impact of these broader system variables. It is believed that attachment_style_mediates the relationship between the ontogenic system level and microsystem/exosystem level variables. Secondary data were used to examine these systemic impacts. The dataset was obtained from the National_Data_Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect. The sample_consisted of 265 women, the majority of whom were African-American and who had a high_school_education or GED. The majority of these women were employed, while others were in school or a training_program at the time of the interview. Over 50 percent_of_the_sample had never been married. A multiple_regression_analysis_was_conducted_to_examine_the_impact of factors from three systems levels on the risk of child abuse. Variables were entered into the multiple_regression equation after they had demonstrated significance in bi-variate analyses with Bonferroni corrections. Mother's age was entered first in this equation in order to control for any potential effect of this variable as it has been shown_to_be_significantly_related_to_risk of abuse. Entered in the second step were the ontogenic variables found to be significant: depression and locus of control. In the third and final step, the microsystem and exosystem_variables found_to_have_a_significant_impact on the risk of abuse were entered: the number of social supports available to the mother, the mother's assessment_of_family_functioning and the frequency of domestic_violence perpetrated against her. Locus of control and mother's depression were demonstrated to be the most important predictors in the equation. Domestic violence_and_social_support were the next most important predictors, with family_functioning becoming non-significant in this equation. This supports the hypothesis that ontogenic variables have the greater_impact in predicting risk of physical abuse. A path_analysis_was_conducted_in_order_to_examine the possible time order and causal_nature of these variables. All variables were included in this analysis. The only variables found to impact the risk of physical_abuse were depression and locus of control. The only route from experiencing childhood_sexual_abuse to the risk of committing child_physical_abuse was through the level of depression currently being experienced by the mother. Mother's locus_of_control impacted the risk of abuse directly as well as through its impact on depression. Risk of abuse was not influenced directly by the experience_of_sexual abuse."

> Create a document-term matrix

The document-term matrix captures how many times each document used a
particular term.

``` r
abstracts_dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(abstracts_corp)
abstracts_dtm
```

    <<DocumentTermMatrix (documents: 199, terms: 4298)>>

    Sparsity           : 98%
    Maximal term length: 25

Thus, about 98% of the possible ‘ties’ between documents and terms do
not actually exist (835074 / (20228 + 835074)), suggesting that many
words are not used widely across abstracts.

# Topic Modeling

We will utilize LDA, latent Dirichlet allocation. LDA attempts to
uncover the underlying, or latent, topics in the corpus of interest.
Different (latent) topics create different word use and we can use the
co-occurrence of words in a document to uncover which words hang
together under a given topic. A topic will have a high probability of
yielding a set of words when those words are used together at high
rates. In a similar way, we can ask which abstracts are likely to fall
into which topic, based on their distribution of word choice.

## Initial Model

Inputs to the algorithm:

``` r
burnin <- 200 # omit iterations at beginning
iter <- 3000 # iterations
thin <- 2000 # omit iterations between kept iterations
seed <- list(2003, 5, 63, 100001, 765)
nstart <- 5 # number of repeated random starts
best <- TRUE # only continue model on best model
k <- 5 # Number of groups (clusters)
```

``` r
ldaOut <- LDA(
  x = abstracts_dtm, k = k,
  method = "Gibbs",
  control = list(
    nstart = nstart, seed = seed, best = best,
    burnin = burnin, iter = iter, thin = thin
  )
)

## Picking th number of topics

``` r
fitmodel <- FindTopicsNumber(
  dtm = abstracts_dtm,
  topics = seq(4, 40, 2),
  metrics = c("CaoJuan2009", "Arun2010"),
  method = "Gibbs",

    best = best, burnin = burnin,
    iter = iter, thin = thin
  ),
  mc.cores = 4, verbose = TRUE
)
```

    fit models... done.
    calculate metrics:
      CaoJuan2009... done.
      Arun2010... done.

``` r

In this case, let’s focus on just a subset of the full matrix. We will
look at the network of abstracts and words associated with topic 20
(“family”) and topic 23 (“gender”).

``` r
ldaOut_topics2 <- topics(ldaOut2)
```

``` r
in_20_23 <- ldaOut_topics2 %in% c(20, 23)
mat_abstract_words_subset <- mat_abstract_words[in_20_23, ]
worduse <- colSums(mat_abstract_words_subset)
mat_abstract_words_subset <- mat_abstract_words_subset[, worduse > 5]
dim(mat_abstract_words_subset)
```

    [1]  24 159

We will construct a two-mode network, where there are two types of nodes
(abstracts and words) and abstracts are connected to words (and vice
versa) but there are no direct ties between nodes of the same type.

``` r
abstract_word_net <-
  graph_from_biadjacency_matrix(mat_abstract_words_subset,
    mode = "all", weighted = T
  )
```

``` r
type <- vertex_attr(abstract_word_net, "type")
table(type)
```

    type
    FALSE  TRUE 
       24   159 

24 abstracts and 159 words.

``` r
V(abstract_word_net)$color[type == TRUE] <- rgb(0, 1, 0, .2)
```

``` r
in20 <- names(which(ldaOut_topics2 == 20))
in23 <- names(which(ldaOut_topics2 == 23))
```

``` r
which_topic20 <- V(abstract_word_net)$name %in% in20
V(abstract_word_net)$color[which_topic20] <- rgb(0, 0, 1, .2)
which_topic23 <- V(abstract_word_net)$name %in% in23
V(abstract_word_net)$color[which_topic23] <- rgb(1, 0, 0, .2)
```

``` r
V(abstract_word_net)$label <- V(abstract_word_net)$name
V(abstract_word_net)$label.color <- rgb(0, 0, .2, .85)
V(abstract_word_net)$label.cex <- .75
V(abstract_word_net)$size <- 3
V(abstract_word_net)$frame.color <- V(abstract_word_net)$color
E(abstract_word_net)$color <- rgb(.5, .5, .5, .04)
```
